This project is to begin using the basic html/css code that has been taught so far and to learn how to use the inspect tool within Google Chrome. 

The objective of the project is to redesign the Google Homepage to include the basic layout of the elements and a basic form for the search funciton. (This doesn't have to be functional though)

The elements that need to be included will include:
    1. The Google Logo 
    2. The search bar (non-funcitonal)
    3. The Search button and the I'm feeling lucky buttons (non-functional)
    4. The header at the top of the page including the links for About and Store on the left hand side and Gmail on the right hand side.
    5. A foot including the Advertising, Business, and How Search Works links. 
    5. Proper formating for the margins,padding,borders and alignment of all items on page.
